XGBoost is an optimized distributed gradient boosting library designed to be highly ***efficient***, ***flexible*** and ***portable***.
It implements machine learning algorithms under the [Gradient Boosting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_boosting) framework.
XGBoost provides a parallel tree boosting (also known as GBDT, GBM) that solve many data science problems in a fast and accurate way.
